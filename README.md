## Trivia
*In an interview, Steven Spielberg said this was the third most difficult movie he has made in his career, behind Jaws (1975) and Saving Private Ryan (1998).*

### Goofs
> Parzival doesn't count to 3 before throwing the Holy Hand Grenade, as depicted in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). In that film, King Arthur counts "One, two, five," is corrected, and shouts "Three!" before throwing the grenade. However, these instructions are never specified in the Oasis so there is no particular reason to expect them to match the Monty Python version.
